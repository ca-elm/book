An important concept in Elm is that functions are values just like numbers, Strings, and Elements. In this chapter, we'll explore different kinds of higher-order functions: functions whose inputs or outputs are themselves functions.

# Currying

Type this program into the editor:

```elm
import Text
import String

main = Text.plainText (String.repeat 5 "Hello!")
```

You'll notice that we imported the String module, which has more useful functions for dealing with String-type values. `String.repeat` is a function that repeats a String the number of times you give it. It's similar to the functions you've seen in the past, but it looks like it takes two inputs. It has the following type annotation:

```elm
String.repeat : Int -> String -> String
```

<p class=note>IntÂ (one of Elm's number types) is short for integer. This means you can't give `String.repeat` a value with a decimal point like 4.35.

But, as we mentioned above, all functions take one input and turn it into one output. There's a trick here: you can also write the declaration for `main` like this:

```elm
main = Text.plainText ((String.repeat 5) "Hello!")
```

Adding parentheses to the type annotation for `String.repeat` makes this even more clear:

```elm
String.repeat : Int -> (String -> String)
```

That is, `String.repeat` really just takes one input: a number. It outputs a function, of type `String -> String`, which takes a String and repeats it that same number of times. This new function remembers the input number you gave to `String.repeat` and uses that number to produce its own outputs (Strings).

Just like any other function, you can save the output that `String.repeat` produces and use it later in your code:

```elm
fiveTimes : String -> String
fiveTimes = String.repeat 5

threeTimes : String -> String
threeTimes = String.repeat 3

main = Text.plainText (fiveTimes "Hello!" ++ threeTimes "Goodbye!")
```

<p class=note>The `++` operator you see here <dfn>concatenates</dfn> the two strings: it creates a new string with the letters in the first string (`"Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!"`) followed by the letters in the second (`"Goodbye!Goodbye!Goodbye!"`). Like arithmetic, it has lower precedence than function application; so you could also write `(fiveTimes "Hello!") ++ (threeTimes "Goodbye!")` to mean the same thing.

This trick of outputting new functions that remember previous inputs is called <dfn>Currying</dfn> (after <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry target=_blank>Haskell Curry</a>). It lets us create functions that appear to take any number of values as input in a language that only allows one input per function. As you saw above, this technique is so common that Elm allows us to remove the parentheses both in the type annotations on curried functions:

```elm
String.repeat : Int -> String -> String
```

and in the invocations of those functions:

```elm
main = Text.plainText (String.repeat 5 "Hello!")
```

We say that function application is <dfn>left-associative</dfn> because Elm treats `a b c` like `(a b) c` instead of `a (b c)`, and the `->` in function types is <dfn>right-associative</dfn> because Elm treats `a -> b -> c` like `a -> (b -> c)` instead of `(a -> b) -> c`. You can add parentheses to force Elm to interpret your code in a particular way.

# Operators Revisited

You've actually seen quite a few curried functions already--they just had strange names, like `+` and `*`. When a function's name comprises symbols rather than letters, Elm treats it as an <dfn>infix operator</dfn>. The "infix" here means that you put the function name *between* the two inputs rather than *in front of* them like we did with `String.repeat`:

```elm
main = asText (1 + 2)
```

If you want to use an infix operator like a normal function, you can put its name in parentheses:

```elm
main = asText ((+) 1 2)
```

<p class=note>Keep in mind that the two sets of parentheses here mean two different things: the inner set tells Elm to treat `+` like a normal name instead of an infix operator, and the outer set prevents Elm from interpreting the chain of function applications as `(asText (+)) 1 2` since function application is left-associative.

Here you can see that `(+)` is another curried function: it takes a number as input and produces another function (which itself takes a number as input and produces the sum). You could write its type signature like this:

```elm
(+) : number -> number -> number
```

Or, equivalently, like this:

```elm
(+) : number -> (number -> number)
```

You can take advantage of the fact that (+) is a curried function by <dfn>partially applying</dfn> it:

```elm
addFive : number -> number
addFive = (+) 5

main = asText (addFive 7)
```

# Composition Decomposition

You can also use the `>>` operator like a normal name. It has a type annotation that looks like this:

```elm
(>>) : (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c
```

Lowercase letters in a type are called <dfn>type variables</dfn>, because they vary based on where you use the function. You can replace a type variable with any type you like; for example, when we used the `>>` operator to compose `toString` and `Text.plainText`, you could annotate the type of `>>` as:

```elm
(>>) : (number -> String) -> (String -> Element) -> number -> Element
```

<p class=note>You can't replace the same type variable with two different types, however. If a function has the type `a -> a -> a`, it can be of type `String -> String -> String` or `Element -> Element -> Element`, but never `String -> Element -> String`.

From this type annotation, it might seem like `>>` should take three inputs: a `number -> String` function, a `String -> Element` function, and a number; then it would produce an Element. This is a perfectly fine way to think about `>>`: as a function that takes two functions and a value as its inputs and returns as output the result of applying those functions in a chain. You could use it like this:

```elm
main : Element
main = (>>) toString Text.plainText 4
```

This code first applies `toString` to 4, then applies `Text.plainText` to the result.

But we've talked about `>>` as an operator that takes just two functions as input, and produces as output another function that applies them in succession to its own input. You might annotate it like this:

```elm
(>>) : (number -> String) -> (String -> Element) -> (number -> Element)
```

The important thing here is that these annotations are the same: these two ways of thinking about `>>` are both useful and valid, and are in fact equivalent. This is just another instance of currying, and we were just partially applying `>>` when we used it as an operator!

You can partially apply `>>` to only one input as well:

```elm
withNumber = (>>) toString

main : Element
main = withNumber Text.plainText 100
```

`withNumber` is a function that takes a function and a number as input, converts the number to a String, and outputs the result of applying the input function to the String. We could annotate it like this:

```elm
withNumber : (String -> a) -> number -> a
```

Notice that `withNumber`'s type still has a type variable in it. Our partially applied function isn't picky about the output type of its input function--it could produce Strings, Elements, or even other functions.

We can even partially apply `withNumber`:

```elm
asText : number -> Element
asText = withNumber Text.plainText

main : Element
main = asText 100
```

In this instance, `withNumber` has type `(String -> Element) -> number -> Element`. We partially apply it to get a function `asText : number -> Element`.

# Flip

The `flip` function is a higher-order function that works on curried functions. It takes as input a function of two inputs and produces as output another function of two inputs with the roles of those inputs swapped. For example, while `(-)` subtracts its second input from its first, `flip (-)` subtracts its first input from its second.

Flip is useful for partially applying functions to inputs that come later in their definition:

```elm
repeatHello = flip String.repeat "Hello!"
repeatHi = flip String.repeat "Hi!"

main = Text.plainText (repeatHello 6 ++ repeatHi 4 ++ repeatHello 3)
```

<p class=note>Make sure you import the `String` module so you can use the `String.repeat` function.

# Aside: Creating Functions

So far we've created functions by composing and applying other functions. You can also create a function by explicitly naming its input:

```elm
square : number -> number
square x = x * x

main = asText (square 4)
```

When you apply a function defined in this way, Elm replaces each occurrence of the input name on the right hand side of the `=` with the input value you provide. For example, when we write `square 4`, Elm calculates `4 * 4` and uses the result as the output of `square`.

You can create a curried function by putting more than one input name before the `=` sign:

```elm
average : number -> number -> number
average x y = (x + y) / 2
```

# Lists of Things

<dfn>Lists</dfn> are another kind of value in Elm. They look like this:

```elm
evenNumbers : List number
evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

noNumbers : List number
noNumbers = []

todo : List String
todo =
  [ "Learn Elm"
  , "Make Games"
  , "???"
  , "Profit!"
  ]
```

Each list can contain any number of items--even no items at all, in the case of `noNumbers`--but all the items in a list must be of the same type. You can't put `10` and `"Learn Elm"` into the same list, because one is a number and the other is a String. The type of a list is `List a`, where `a` is the type of each item in the list.

Lists can even contain functions, as long as they all have the same input and output types:

```elm
repeaters : List (String -> String)
repeaters = [String.repeat 2, String.repeat 5, String.repeat 10]
```

They can also contain other lists:

```elm
nestedLists : List (List number)
nestedLists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
```

The `toString` function actually is actually an `a -> String` function--that is, it can convert any kind of value into a string. Before now it was only useful on numbers, but you can also use it to convert lists to Strings so you can display them:

```elm
main = Text.plainText (toString [1, 2, 3, 4])
```

# Working with Lists

You can use the `List.length` function from the `List` module to compute the number of items in a list.

```elm
import List

main = Text.plainText (toString (List.length [4, 5, 6]))
```

Since `List.length` works on any kind of list, you could annotate it like this:

```elm
List.length : List a -> Int
```

The `List` module provides some useful functions for dealing with lists of numbers:

- `List.sum` adds the numbers in a list and outputs the sum
- `List.product` multiplies the numbers in a list and outputs the product
- `List.maximum` outputs the largest number in a list
- `List.minimum` outputs the smallest number in a list

# Map, 2, 3, 4

A useful higher-order function for dealing with lists is called `List.map`. It has the following type:

```elm
List.map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
```

<p class=idea>Just by looking at this type annotation, what do you think the `List.map` function does?

`List.map` takes as input a function from one type to another, and a list of values of that first type. It applies the function to each item of the list and outputs a new list with the results of each application. For example, these two declarations of `numbers` are the same:

```elm
numbers = List.map sqrt [1, 4, 9, 16]

numbers = [sqrt 1, sqrt 4, sqrt 9, sqrt 16]
```

You can also think of `map` as a function that turn functions which operate on a single value into functions that operate on lists of values.

```elm
sqrt : number -> number

listSqrt : List number -> List number
listSqrt = List.map sqrt
```

The list module also contains `List.map2`, `List.map3`, etc., of the following types:

```elm
List.map2 : (a -> b -> c) -> List a -> List b -> List c
List.map3 : (a -> b -> c -> d) -> List a -> List b -> List c -> List d
...
```

`map2` is like `map`, but it operates on curried functions of two inputs. For each item in the output list, it draws inputs from its two input lists:

```elm
sums : List number
sums = List.map2 (+) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

greetings : List String
greetings =
  List.map2 (++)
  ["Hello ", "Good day ", "Hi "]
  ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]

main = asText sums
```

<p class=idea>What happens when you use `map` instead of `map2` on a curried function of two inputs?

Similarly, `map3` and `map4` operate on curried functions of three and four inputs, respectively.

# Fold (from the Left)

`List.foldl` is another extremely useful function for dealing with lists.
